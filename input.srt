1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,134
So at some point in their lives, nearly everybody has wanted to dig a hole

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:07,662
down to the center of the earth. The only problem is nobody

3
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:11,350
ever has actually dug a hole down that far. This leads us to the

4
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:15,590
question that this video is all about. If humanity decided that digging

5
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:19,158
a hole was the number one objective of our species, then how

6
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:22,790
deep down could we actually dig with modern day technology?

7
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:26,830
Lets say that we start somewhere on the earths surface and just start digging from

8
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:30,524
there. Not too far down, at 1.8 meters, and we arrive

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:34,140
at the standard grave depth in western culture. So if youre afraid of

10
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:38,028
zombies, this is how far down theyll be coming from. 4 meters

11
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:42,100
down and we arrive at the depth that pharaoh tutankhamuns tomb was discovered.

12
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:45,948
At. A little further, at 6 meters below the surface, weve reached the maximum

13
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:49,540
depth that metal detectors can pick up signals from. At 12

14
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:52,508
meters we can find the deepest burrows dug by animals,

15
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,878
the Nile crocodile. A little further down, at 20 meters

16
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:59,926
and we arrive at the depth of the Paris catacombs beneath the city of Paris.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,294
A tomb that holds the remains of over 6 million people.

18
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:07,022
Double that distance to 40 meters down and we can see the deepest

19
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:10,710
swimming pool in the world. If you drained this pool and jumped into

20
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,982
it from the top, it would take nearly 3 seconds before you

21
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:17,574
would hit the bottom. 100 meters down is the usual distance that

22
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:20,918
governments bury their nuclear waste at. And just beneath that,

23
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:24,766
at 105.5 meters down, is the deepest metro station in the

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,214
world, located in Kiev. Moving on to 122

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,198
meters down and we see the deepest known point that a plants roots have

26
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:34,766
ever reached. A fig tree in South Africa.

27
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,758
220 meters down and we arrive at the deepest river in the world,

28
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:42,566
the Congo river in Africa. Beyond that, at 240

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,566
meters, you can ride through the deepest railway tunnel in the world that connects

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,774
the japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. But at 287

31
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:54,166
meters down, you can drive through the deepest road tunnel in the world.

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,546
In Norway, 305 meters down and you would still be

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,146
vulnerable to the B 82 earth penetrating nuclear warhead,

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,634
which can destroy structures up to this depth beneath the surface.

35
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:08,922
Incredibly though, at 392 meters, we arrive at the deepest well

36
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:12,562
and possibly deepest hole ever dug by hand. This is

37
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:15,962
the Woodingdene water well in the UK, and it was dug all the

38
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:19,098
way back in 1862. At 603

39
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:23,162
meters down, we arrive at something, the deepest vertical

40
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:26,766
drop inside of a cave. If you were unfortunate enough to

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,366
be in this cave and fall down this hole, the fall would be higher up

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,918
than falling. From the top of the one World Trade center in New York,

43
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:37,430
and the fall would take you over 11 seconds before hitting

44
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:41,102
the bottom. Even further down though at 700 meters is where the

45
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:45,278
chilean miners were trapped at for 69 days back in 2010.

46
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:48,950
970 meters down is the deepest hole ever dug

47
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:52,278
that still has an open sky above it. The Bingham Canyon

48
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,926
open pit mine in Utah. This pit is so deep that

49
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,342
you could place the tallest building in the entire world in the center

50
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:03,198
and still have over 100 more meters to the surface.

51
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:06,782
Much further down at 19 10 meters though,

52
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:10,862
is where the deepest concert ever held happened by the band Agonizer

53
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:14,214
in Finland. 1640 2 meters

54
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:17,150
down is the depth of the deepest lake on Earth,

55
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,918
Lake Baikal in Russia. And 1857

56
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,872
meters down is the deepest part of the Grand Canyon. The deepest

57
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:28,712
known cave on earth is located 2197

58
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:32,264
meters beneath the surface in Georgia. But the deepest hole

59
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:35,544
that you could actually fall into goes way deeper

60
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:40,672
than even this. All the way down at 3132

61
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,064
meters is the bottom of the Moab Khatsong mineshaft in

62
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:48,056
South Africa. Taking the elevator takes four and a half minutes to

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,136
reach the bottom. But if you fell into it from the top it would take

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,304
you 25 entire seconds for you to hit the bottom

65
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:57,800
and think about what you've just done long enough to receive

66
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:01,304
and miss an entire phone call. Even further down

67
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:05,528
at 3600 meters is the deepest point that a multicellular

68
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:09,512
organism has been found alive, this freaky looking worm.

69
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:13,168
But human beings themselves have been even deeper than this.

70
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:16,440
4000 meters down is the deepest part of the

71
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:20,192
deepest mine on Earth, also located in South Africa.

72
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:24,544
The trip from the surface down to the bottom takes over an hour to complete

73
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:28,368
and the temperature at the bottom can reach a sweltering 66

74
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,952
degrees celsius. 6000 meters is the average

75
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:35,088
depth of the oceanic crust beneath the ocean floor.

76
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:38,776
Way down at 8848 meters is

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,448
the height of Mount Everest if it were placed underground instead.

78
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:45,944
10,994 meters down

79
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:49,304
is the bottom of the Marianas trench which is the deepest part

80
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:52,864
of the ocean. I already covered the depth of the ocean in another

81
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:57,528
video, but unbelievably humans have actually dug down significantly

82
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:03,352
deeper than even this. For reference about whats next 11,887

83
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,952
meters is the average altitude that a commercial airliner flies

84
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:11,096
at. But deeper than that at 12,262

85
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,424
meters is the depth of the Kola superdeep borehole,

86
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:18,424
a project where the Soviet Union attempted to drill all the way through the

87
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:22,136
earths crust. They only reached a third of the way there though because the

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,816
temperature at this depth reached 180 degrees celsius

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,440
which was too hot for the drill to continue operating any further.

90
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:32,792
The hole is also only 23 cm wide

91
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:36,416
so luckily you cant accidentally fall into it. If you

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,000
dropped a quarter down the shaft though, it would take about 50 seconds

93
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:43,528
before it hit the bottom. Recently however, this depth has

94
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:47,376
been surpassed by the Z 44 Chavio oil and gas well

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,592
which has drilled down to a depth of 12,376

96
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:55,518
meters. Thats the equivalent of stacking 15 burj khalifas

97
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:59,134
on top of each other and currently represents the deepest hole that

98
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:02,942
humanity has ever dug. The crust however can extend

99
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:06,726
down to 70,000 meters below the earths surface and the

100
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,102
planets center is located 6371

101
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:13,774
km down. If the surface of the earth is Lisbon,

102
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,534
Portugal and the planets center is Astana, Kazakhstan then

103
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:21,834
humanity so far has just ventured this tiny,

104
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:25,562
insignificant distance. If you enjoyed the video that you
